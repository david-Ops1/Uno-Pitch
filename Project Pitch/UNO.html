   <h1 style="border:rgb(255, 40, 32); border-width:5px; border-style:dashed"> Virtual UNO</h1>
   <h3>The game will emulate the classic card game, that will have everybody shouting, "UNO"!

   <h2 style="border:rgb(255, 40, 32); border-width:3px; border-style:dashed;">Virtual UNO</h2>
   <p>Originally developed in a suburb of Cincinnati, UNO has been bringing people
      joy for half a decade. Why not bring that joy to the people who live their day to day lives completely online!
      Thats where the developers come in.
      People don't have time anymore to make appointments in their hectic schedules to drive to a friend's house. Fear
      of spreading
      plague runs rampant. Say no more, I have a solution. Virtual UNO is here to save the day. No need to spread
      viruses any more. The only
      thing that they'll be spreading is joy and a bit of annoyance. No need to drive hours away to a friend's house.
      Instead of going to that concert or large gathering UNO says, "hey wanna play a game". People prefer
      Virtual UNO over large social gatherings any day. I raise you a +4! Now thats UNO way of saying it!

   <h2 style="border:rgb(255, 40, 32); border-width:3px; border-style:dashed;">Goals:</h2>
   <ul>

      <li>Virtual UNO GUI: table with a stack of cards in the middle and players on the sides</li>
      <li>Card colors (25 of each): red, green, blue, and yellow</li>
      <li>Special card types: skips, reverses, draw two, draw four, wild, customizable, and special rule</li>
      <li>Deck size: 112 cards</li>
      <li>2-10 players</li>
      <li>Doesn't spread the human types of viruses</li>
      <li>Ready when your ready</li>
      <li>Spreads joy to a pandemic ridden people</li>
   </ul>

   <h2 style="border:rgb(255, 40, 32); border-width:3px; border-style:dashed;">Customer(s) and other Stakeholders</h2>
   <p>People who just want to have some safe fun without spreading illness. Also people who
      don't want to drive to a friend's house and want an online experience of UNO. Anybody who wants to play UNO
      without having to do much actual human to human interaction.
   </p>
   <h2 style="border:rgb(255, 40, 32); border-width:3px; border-style:dashed;">Technology</h2>
   <p>We will be using java to develop this software game and
      using github as a repository for all our code.
   </p>
   <h2 style="border:rgb(255, 40, 32); border-width:3px; border-style:dashed;">Scope</h2>
   <p>I believe setting up the randomization of the cards and the actual game itself can be completed. UNO
      doesn't appear to be too complex of a card game to not be completed this semester.
